# vmrseq: Detecting variably methylated regions (VMRs) from single-cell bisulfite sequencing

The R package `vmrseq` is a novel computational tool developed for pinpointing variably methylated regions (VMRs) in scBS-seq data without prior knowledge on size or location. High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylation allows studying inter-cellular epigenetic heterogeneity, but this task faces the challenges of sparsity and noise. vmrseq overcomes these challenges and identifies variably methylated regions accurately and robustly.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `vmrseq` in R from Bioconductor (recommended) or GitHub with:

``` r
### Install stable version from Bioconductor
 if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
     install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("vmrseq")

## Or development version from Github
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nshen7/vmrseq")
```

## Online Vignette

- An online vignette of 'Get Started' on the `vmrseq` package can be found at 
[https://rpubs.com/nshen7/vmrseq-vignette](https://rpubs.com/nshen7/vmrseq-vignette).
