Title: Probabilistic Modeling of Single-cell Methylation Heterogeneity
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Ning Shen
Maintainer: Ning Shen <ning.shen@stat.ubc.ca>
Description: High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylation allows studying inter-cellular epigenetic heterogeneity, but this task faces the challenges of sparsity and noise. We present vmrseq, a statistical method that overcomes these challenges and identifies variably methylated regions accurately and robustly.
