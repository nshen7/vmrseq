# vmrseq: Detecting variably methylated regions (VMRs) from single-cell bisulfite sequencing

The R package `vmrseq` is a novel computational tool developed for pinpointing variably methylated regions (VMRs) in scBS-seq data without prior knowledge on size or location. High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylation allows studying inter-cellular epigenetic heterogeneity, but this task faces the challenges of sparsity and noise. vmrseq overcomes these challenges and identifies variably methylated regions accurately and robustly.
