Title: Probabilistic Modeling of Single-cell Methylation Heterogeneity
Version: 0.99.2
Authors@R: person("Ning", "Shen", email = "ning.shen.wk@gmail.com",role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylation allows studying inter-cellular epigenetic heterogeneity, but this task faces the challenges of sparsity and noise. We present vmrseq, a statistical method that overcomes these challenges and identifies variably methylated regions accurately and robustly.
